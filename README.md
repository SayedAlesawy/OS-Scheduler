# OS-Schedular-
A basic OS scheduler implementing some of the most common scheduling algorithms. 

# Implemented algorithms:
1- Non-preemtive First Come First Serve (FCFS).
2- Non-preemtive Height Priority First (HPF).
3- Preemptive Round Robin (RR).
4- Preemptive Shortest Time Remanining (STRN).

# Provided Statistics 
1- Process waiting time.
2- Process turn around time.
3- Process weight turn around time.
4- Average turn around time.
5- Average weighted turn around time. 

The scheduler handles variable Context Switching and CPU Quantum time.

We have also implemented a process generator that generates processes' parameters based on random distributions.
